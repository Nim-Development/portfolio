A result oriented Laravel developer with +2 years experience in 
developing and maintaining web applications.
I am self taught and became advanced by working in a dev team
and by developing 5+ projects as a freelancer.

Besides the obvious, my motivation for working in a dev team 
is to learn new skills and advance myself to the next level.

I love laravel because it is a robust and complete framework. By investing lots of hours in this framework I became fast at writing 
laravel applications and I gained a deeper understanding of its underlying 
processes (like the service container).
I am also comfortable at laravel package development.

Recently VueJs caught my interest, I completed a few basic 
applications and I am comfortable with its fundamentals.

My major goals for the next years are:
- Working in a professional dev team
- Becoming fluent at the Laravel/VueJs stack
